# Ninja

Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.
https://ninja-build.org/

See [the manual](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html) or
`doc/manual.asciidoc` included in the distribution for background
and more details.

Binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows are available on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases).
Run `./ninja -h` for Ninja help.

Installation is not necessary because the only required file is the
resulting ninja binary. However, to enable features like Bash
completion and Emacs and Vim editing modes, some files in misc/ must be
copied to appropriate locations.

If you're interested in making changes to Ninja, read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

## Building Ninja itself

You can either build Ninja via the custom generator script written in Python or
via CMake. For more details see
[the wiki](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki).

### Python
```./config-py_format-json-js-bootstrap_css.js```

This will generate the `ninja` binary and a `build.ninja` file you can now use
to build Ninja with itself.

### CMake
```cmake -Bbuild-cmake```
```cmake --build build-cmake```

The `ninja` binary will now be inside the `build-cmake` directory (you can
choose any other name you like).

To run the unit tests:
```./build-cmake/ninja_test```
